    -- Sarcasm Detector

Sarcasm is a form of speech act in which the speakers convey their message in an implicit way. 
The inherently ambiguous nature of sarcasm sometimes makes it hard even for humans to decide 
whether an utterance is sarcastic or not. 
Recognition of sarcasm can benefit many sentiment analysis Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications,
such as review summarization, customer care systems, dialogue systems and review ranking systems.

The aim of this project was, therefore, to study and explore the techniques that can be used to detect sarcasm 
in one of the most-influential communication platforms - twitter.

Two approaches were tried to detect sarcasm in tweets:
1. Mining patterns from tweets and extracting features of sarcastic tweets and non-sarcastic tweets and training a classifier.
2. Rule-based detection of obvious and most-probable patterns in sarcastic tweets.

The resulting solution was encased in a web application and deployed for community use.
